MDtime.out: Measured running time (right column) as a function of the number of atoms (left column)
of a simple molecular-dynamics (MD) program, md.c.

lmd_sqrt_flop.[c|h|in]: C source code|header file|input file for linked-list-cell molecular
dynamics program, with polynomial implementation of sqrt() function. To compile the
program, type
  cc -O -o lmd_sqrt_flop lmd_sqrt_flop.c -lm
which will creata an executable named lmd_sqrt_flop. To run the executable, type
  ./lmd_sqrt_flop < lmd_sqrt_flop.in
Note "." denotes the current directory, thus ./lmd_sqrt_flop is the absolute path to the
executable, lmd_sqrt_flop. "<" directs the contents of lmd_sqrt_flop.in into the standard
output of the lmd_sqrt_flop program. On Discovery cluster, the C compiler is "gcc"
instead of "cc" in the above example. The running time, along with measured flop/s performance, 
will be reported in the standard output of the program.
