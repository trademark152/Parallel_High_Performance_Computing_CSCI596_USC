This folder (csci596-as04) contains instruction and codes needed to complete assignment 4
for CSCI 596.

as04.pdf: Assignment.

pmd.c, pmd.h, pmd.in: MPI program, header file, and input parameter file for parallel
molecular dynamics (MD); note that the header and parameters are preset for part I --
for part II, you need to modify them according to the description in as04.pdf.
To compile pmd.c, type:
mpicc -O -o pmd pmd.c -lm

pmd_irecv.sl: Slurm script for part I. It compares the runtime of the original pmd.c and
its asynchronous-message version, pmd_irecv.c, written by you. The script repeats
the comparison for three times, so that you can compute the average runtime.

cal_pv.c: Data structures and function for calculating probability density of velocity;
its contents need be merged into your program, pmd_split.c, for part II.

pmd_split.sl: Slurm script for part II.
