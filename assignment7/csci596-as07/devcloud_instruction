On Cygwin runs:
# set up ssh connections
bash C:/Users/trade/Downloads/setup-devcloud-access-51841.txt

# Clean up for security:
rm C:/Users/trade/Downloads/setup-devcloud-access-51841.txt

# after connecting
ssh devcloud

# go to local drive C:/Tuan Minh/USC coursework/Fall2020/CSCI596/assignment/assignment7
(careful with the spaces) -> easier to avoid folder path with spaces
scp -r csci596-as07 devcloud:home/u51841/project_mt/
